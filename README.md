## Overview

We spend more energy every day to recycle the products we use, and our carbon footprint is increasing day by day.


Sorting wastes in facilities for recycling wastes extra energy. In order to prevent this, we can use recycling boxes by consuming less energy

We need to include recycling in our lives to reduce the damage we do to nature, but most people do not know where or how to use recycling bins.

In this project, which covers the 11th, 12th, 13th and 15th articles of [the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), we aim to increase the use of recycling bins.

## What is RECYCLE MAP? 

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93054796/228678174-c68e408d-1b48-4e53-8eca-84766a24bad5.png" width="50" height="50" /> Recycle Map is an application that can show the location of the recycling bins by separating them according to their types, and can show the current status of the bins according to user interaction.

Users can find the location of the nearest recycling bin and detailed information about the bin by selecting the type of waste they want to recycle and searching by the location they want on the map.
